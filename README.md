# Structured Content Generator (GenAI)

## Objective
Build a GenAI-powered application that generates **strictly structured JSON**
using a local LLM, with validation and retry logic to ensure reliability.

## Features
- Local LLM via Ollama (phi3:3.8b)
- No API keys or paid services
- Strict JSON schema enforcement
- Self-healing JSON extraction
- Validation + retry logic

## Why This Matters
LLMs are probabilistic and frequently break structured output rules.
This project demonstrates how production GenAI systems enforce reliability.
